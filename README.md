# Video-Processing-App
This is an android app designed for video transmission from one mobile to another.
It is a part of ITRA DISARM Internship.
It uses Opencv and Android Media Codec for Video compression and processing.
This app is still under process, and only temporal compression algorithm has been applied to the video frames.
Best works when used with ES-File Explorer.
